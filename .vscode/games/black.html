            <p>Spooky Spectacle</p>
            <p>By SamuelJ2000 08.18.2023</p>
            <p>"Black is a spine-tingling adventure that combines the thrill of the supernatural 
                with a dash of dark humor. I couldn't help but chuckle at our hooded hero's witty 
                one-liners while facing off against hordes of skeletons. It's like the Grim Reaper 
                decided to moonlight as a comedian. A must-play for those who appreciate a good 
                laugh in the afterlife!"</p>
            <h2>Funny!</h2>
            <p>By TheHoodedSavior 08.20.2023</p>
            <p>"Black is a unique and captivating journey into the macabre. The game's art style 
                and eerie soundscapes set the perfect mood for exploring ancient tombs. I enjoyed 
                every moment, but I have to dock a star for some minor glitches that occasionally 
                made our hooded hero look like he was breakdancing with the skeletons. Still, a 
                spooky good time!"</p>
            <h2>Deadly fun!</h2>
            <p>By JackBlackFan 25.08.2023</p>
            <p>"Black is a revelation! Who knew that the world of skeletons and graves could be 
                this entertaining? The game's humor, mixed with the dark fantasy setting, is a 
                winning combination. The black hooded protagonist is an instant icon, and I can't 
                wait for a sequel. Maybe next time, he can teach the skeletons some dance moves!"</p>
